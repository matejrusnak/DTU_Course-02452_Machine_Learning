    "In last week’s lecture and exercises, we explored generalization error, cross-validation, and the problem of overfitting.  \n",
    "This week, we’ll follow it up, by learning how to evaluate and compare model performance statistically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to develop objective methods for deciding which model performs best - not just based on a single error estimate, but by also taking into account the uncertainty in those estimates. Relying on a single number can be misleading, especially when models perform similarly.  \n",
    "By quantifying the uncertainty around our performance estimates, we can make more reliable and statistically sound comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Estimate the performance of a single model and compute confidence intervals for that estimate.  \n",
    "- Compare multiple models statistically, with confidence intervals, for both classification and regression tasks.  \n",
    "- Understand how different evaluation setups — **Setup I** and **Setup II** — influence how we estimate and interpret performance.  \n",
    "- Evaluate classification models using ROC curves and the Area Under the Curve (AUC).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will address two key questions:\n",

    "1. How can we **estimate a reasonable confidence interval** $\\left[\\theta_L, \\theta_U\\right]$ for the **accuracy of a single classifier**, based on its predictions on a dataset?  \n",
