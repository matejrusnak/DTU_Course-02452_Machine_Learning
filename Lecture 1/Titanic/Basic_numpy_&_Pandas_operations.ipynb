    "# Week 0: Exercise introduction and setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is an *optional* pre-exercise. You can use the exercise to check that you have the sufficient coding skills, as well as ensuring that you have your integrated development environment (IDE) setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Part 0: Downloading Python, Anaconda and your IDE\n",
    "- Part 1: Getting started with Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "- Part 2: Getting started with Python\n",
    "- Part 3: Matrix operations\n",
    "- Part 4: Basic plotting\n",
    "- Part 5: An introduction to Pandas\n",
    "- Part 6: Recommended materials to catch up on Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "- Have setup your Python IDE.\n",
    "- Understand Jupyter Notebooks and the various shortcuts.\n",
    "- Write and execute basic Python code.\n",
    "- Understand how data can be represented as vectors and matrices in numerical Python (NumPy).\n",
    "- Understand basic ways of plotting data. \n",
    "- Understand the basics of Pandas.\n",
    "- Understand the format of the exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "The exercises in the course are structured such that you work your way through an exercise notebook like this one. Your task will be to fill in missing pieces of code and explanations to make the Notebooks run, complemented by relevant pen-and-paper problems. Filling in the missing parts of the code, will help you understand the most important aspects of modelling data, as well as understanding the models and methods introduced throughout the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter any problems in doing this exercise - in e.g. setting up your IDE - make sure to get in touch with a teaching assistant after the first lecture at the exercises. The first real course exercise (Week 1) will be done after the first lecture. Note that if you have difficulties following the scripts, catching up on your progamming-skills are to be done as a self-study exercise (see optional material in the end of this notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend that you create a folder named `02452exercises` dedicated to the course exercises. Each week, you will receive a zip file via DTU Learn containing the associated files, which should be placed within this directory, for example, `02452exercises/week3`.\n",

    "We simulate measurements from two sensors (sensor 1 and sensor 2) for a period of 10 seconds, and we say that the sensors output measurents in millivolt.  Since the two measurements are done at the same time, we want to plot them in the same figure. Furthermore, we want to make sure that the axes are labelled correctly both with a name and a designation of the unit of measurement. We also need to make sure that it is easy to see which curves comes from which sensor. Lastly, we ensure that the axes are readable (large enough), both when looking at them in the IDE, but also in an exported version that we might use in a report about the sensors.\n",

    "## Part 6: Recommended materials to catch up on Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The following online materials are recommended:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Introduction into python environment, syntax and data structures](docs.python.org/tutorial). Recommended reading - sections 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.\n",
    "- [Tutorial introducing the scientific computing in Python, array and matrix operations, indexing and slicing matrices](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/).\n",
    "- [Useful reference to scientific computing in Python if you have previous experience with Matlab programming](docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html).\n",
    "- [Documentation and examples related to the matplotlib module](matplotlib.sourceforge.net) - which we shall use extensively throughout the course to visualize data and results.\n",
    "- [Overview of VSCode IDE for Python code editing/debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).\n",
    "- [Series of video tutorials covering basics of Python programming (using a different IDE)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_).\n",
    "- [DTUs Introduction to Programming (using Python) for absolute beginners](https://02002.compute.dtu.dk/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python tutorial (sections 1-5) and NumPy tutorial are especially recommended. The more you get acquainted with Python now, the easier it will be for you to solve machine learning problems in the following weeks. You will benefit from this course most if you try to implement the solutions on your own, before checking the correct answers. Nevertheless, if you run into problems, the guidelines and the correct scripts will be always provided for your reference."
